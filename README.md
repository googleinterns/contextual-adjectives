# Contextual Adjectives Summer Intern 2020

This is an experimental project done as part of summer internship 2020. The
project is owned by the language SV team in BLR lang-lr-blr@.

The aim of this project is to help users find an appropriate adjective a noun.
There are some queries found in the search logs (~10k quereis a day) that seek
adjectives for noun. (eg. [good adjectves for babies], [adjectives for tatoos]
etc.). We would like to build a system that can categorize the adjectives for a
noun as [positive], [negative] and by property [size], [beauty], [speed] etc.


The data used in the Project is taken from BookCorpus. [Aligning Books and Movies:
